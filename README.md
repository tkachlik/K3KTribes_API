# K3KTribes_API
This is a continuation of our bootcamp team project - an API for a simple online strategic game.

This project started out in a team of three developers. After the bootcamp, we still want to hone our skills and learn new things. I decided to continue this particular project, refactor and clean up the code, and then add new features I would like to learn how to implement, but didn't get around to it during the course. So, while some of the code was not originally written by me, and while we still keep in touch in the original team and help each other with our growth as developers, this is now a stand-alone repo.

For now, the primary focus will be on development as such. Documentation will be added later.

## My main responsibilities and which parts of the code are mine
- Player Management (incl. JWT token flow and third party API SendGrid for automated emails)
- Implementation of the parallel testing database
- Productions controller and all related services and repos methods
- Custom data validation error model + unifying API response model across the app
- Integration tests (creating templates on which my colleagues could lean on when writing tests for their code)
- Unit tests with mocking for my code
- current CI pipeline here on GitHub
